## 🧱 Step 2. Local Setup & Branch Creation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:sbee-lab/infra.git
   cd <repo>
   ```

2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b onboarding/<your-username>
   ```

3. Add your user configuration:

   - Add entry to:

     - `modules/users/students.nix` _(if role = student)_
       or
       `modules/users/researchers.nix` _(if role = researchers)_
       and follow the comments

4. (Optional) Add an Age key placeholder if needed:

- If you need access for system/service secrets, add your ssh-age key on `pubkeys.json` and add your secret perimission in `.sops.nix`
- Note that you should update secrets using `inv update-sops-files`
